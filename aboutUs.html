                Many times districts are unresponsive to studentâ€™s requests for a change in curriculum to help include a more culturally diverse and socially inclusive curriculum to help foster a culturally knowledgeable and responsive school community. Many efforts to this end have just recently gained some momentum, however, changing the curriculum is a momentous task. There are many wonderful school clubs which are also advocating for cultural and social diversity in curriculum and in school settings. However, many of these clubs work individually or within their own bubble of influence and collaboration between different cultural and social identity clubs is limited. Lastly, not many educators share much interest in cultural diversity events or information either because of their busy days or just that efforts towards more diversity and inclusion in education are still novel and lack much reputation.
